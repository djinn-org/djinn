Competitors
===========

List of our (known) competitors, and the reasons we are better.

Please keep adding competitors, as many as possible.
For each competitor, mention two things, in bullet point list style:

- Reasons to choose us (*Djinn*) instead of them
- Good ideas we can *borrow* from them

Robin ([website](https://robinpowered.com/features#mobileApp))

Reasons to choose us:

- [Price](https://robinpowered.com/pricing): $249 / month for 15 months is too expensive

Jooxter ([website](http://www.jooxter.com/))

**TODO:** Check the price by sending an Email as a client

Reasons to choose us:

- Price: We will need to be aggrasive on the price. We will wait to see what they are offering
- Our system is not relying on smartphones, no constraint is putted on users  

Ideas we can borrow:

- Navigation in the bulding to find a room
- Penser un outil d'analyse statistique (disponibilité, rotation...)

Exakis - Intelligent rooms ([brochure](http://www.exakis.com/media/11238/Connectez-vos-salles-de-r%C3%A9unions-avec-Intelligent-Rooms.pdf))

**TODO:** Check the price by sending an Email as a client (contact: contact@exakis.com)

What they are:

- French company: société de conseil et d’expertises technologiques (300 people)
- They are "Microsoft Gold Partner" 
- In 2014 they were "Microsoft Partner of the year"
- Itelligent rooms is only one of their products

What the system do:

- Zwave and Bluetooth LE (probably beacons) detectors on a meshed network
- Mobile app and outlook plugin
- Seems to be working only for Exchange 2013 and Office 365

Reasons to choose us:

- Price: We will need to be aggrasive on the price. We will wait to see what they are offering
- Sadly, I think only the price can make the difference for our system, they seem to use "passif" detectors and no need to have a smart phone... 

Ideas we can borrow:

- Mash network for our docks ?

Condeco Software ([website](http://www.condecosoftware.com/fr/))
-----
**TODO:** Contact for the price Tel: +33 (0)1 76 70 10 15 Email: Europe@condecosoftware.com

What they are:

- A big world wide based company: 10 offices around the globe...
- Specialized in managing meeting rooms and workspaces
- They worked/still work with 500 clients, some of them are big guys (BNP, Barclays, Rolls Royce, BP, Reuters, Universal, Nomura, PWC...)

What the system do:

- Room Booking Tools: A calendar, can work with Office/Lotus, and can be used from smartphone/Outlook. It also has the meeting room service option and can handle visitors (printing badges(!), letting the host know if the visitor is here)
- Desk Booking Tools: That's something big !
- Video Conferencing
- Digital Signage: The scrennoutside the room, plus a big one to see all the rooms at one time)
- Occupancy Sensors: An infrared detector, but used exclusively for detection and stitistics (does not unbook a room). They put it underneath the table, one for every seat. It uses a battery (2 year lifespan)

Reasons to choose us:

- Automatic unbooking system they don't have
- But frankly, this is a tought competitor. I would go and say : Because we're cooler that them? :) 
- Maybe price...

Ideas we can borrow:

- Everything! we need to talk about it

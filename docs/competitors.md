List of our (known) competitors, and the reasons we are better.

Please keep adding competitors, as many as possible.
For each competitor, mention two things, in bullet point list style:

- Reasons to choose us (*Djinn*) instead of them

**TODO:** Check the price by sending an Email as a client

Reasons to choose us:

- Price: We will need to be aggrasive on the price. We will wait to see what they are offering
- Our system is not relying on smartphones, no constraint is putted on users  

Ideas we can borrow:

What they are:

- Big french company: société de conseil et d’expertises technologiques (300 people)
- They are "Microsoft Gold Partner" 
- In 2014 they were "Microsoft Partner of the year"
- Itelligent rooms is only one of their products

What the system do:

- Zwave and Bluetooth LE (probably beacons) detectors on a meshed network
- Mobile app and outlook plugin
- Seems to be working only for Exchange 2013 and Office 365

Reasons to choose us:

- Price: We will need to be aggrasive on the price. We will wait to see what they are offering
- Sadly, I think only the price can make the difference for our system, they seem to use "passif" detectors and no need to have a smart phone... 

Ideas we can borrow:

- Mash network for our docks ?
